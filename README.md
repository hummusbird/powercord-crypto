# pc-crypto
pc-crypto is a powercord plugin version of my discord bot, ethernet.It uses the coingecko API to get price data, and the [asciichart](https://github.com/kroitor/asciichart) module to create cool ascii price-history charts

pc-crypto is **NOT** a selfbot. It never uploads embeds, and doesn't respond to other users. It uses powercord's built in command function, and uses code blocks to neatly arrange data.

# Installation
Open your powercord plugin folder, and run

`git clone https://github.com/hummusbird/pc-crypto`

Make sure you run `npm install` to install dependencies.
